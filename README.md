🛡️ Phishing Extension – IP Proof

This repository serves as a public timestamp and ownership declaration for the Chrome extension project aimed at detecting phishing and suspicious emails. It is created to document and safeguard the original idea, design approach, and ownership rights of the project before any implementation begins.

🔍 Project Overview

The planned Chrome extension will detect phishing emails, flag suspicious content, and offer user-friendly alerts. It will work by scanning Gmail inboxes, using backend logic to identify risky links, domains, or patterns, and warning users before they interact with potentially dangerous emails.

📄 Files Included

IP_Declaration.md – A formal declaration asserting the original idea and ownership.

Future files: architecture drafts, mockups, backend concepts (TBD).
